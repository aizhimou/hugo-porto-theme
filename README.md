Hugo Porto is a personal portfolio theme for Hugo. It features a minimalist design that focuses on showcasing your
projects and achievements. This theme is perfect for developers, designers, and creatives who want to create a simple

The theme was inspired and based originally on the [Porto](https://boxmodel.dev/templates/porto/html) theme from
[BoxModelDev](https://boxmodel.dev/)'s guys.
